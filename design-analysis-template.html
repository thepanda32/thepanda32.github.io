   <h2>Design Principles</h2>
   <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs three items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

   <h3>Proximity &mdash;

   <p>
     With Proximity, the website put the ‘Bestsellers’ categories of books
     next to each other that it could be easily found.
     Thus, drawing the users attention to the items right next to it,
     assuming they were going to be similar. With this proximity it helps
     show that they relate in some shape or form.

   </p>

   <h3>Alignment &mdash;

   </h3>
   <img src="alignment.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating alignment in use">
   <p>
     An example alignment found on this website is found in the side tab
     bringing up more options. With the left side alignment,
     it shows the different tabs for more information.
     When one of these selections was chosen, it added a slight alignment to
     the sub categories.
     Allowing the user to recognize the sub categories were separate.

   <h3>Repetition &mdash;

   </h3>
   <img src="Repetative.png" alt="Screen shot illustrating repetition in use">
   <p>
     In the mobile website for thriftbooks.com,
     the repetition is consistent throughout the website.
     The font color, size and type are consistent and repetitive which makes
     the user interface easy and understandable. Other elements such as like
     images, proximity and alignment of the text and images are all consistent
     and repetitive in all the pages. The vision and pattern in all of the
     web-pages gives a sense of familiarity and consistency.
   </p>

   <h3>Contrast &mdash;
     Serah Doraiswamy
   </h3>
   <img src="Contrast 1.png" alt="Screen shot illustrating contrast in use">
   <p>
     The contrast is visually appealing in terms of the text color,
     background color, shape and size of the images and objects.
     The design principle of contrast which is used in this website makes
     the web-pages more clean and visually appealing.

   <h3>Typography &mdash;

     The typography seems to follow a specific pattern on this website.

   <h2>Site Purpose Statement</h2>
   <p>
    The purpose of the site is to make it convenient to buy necessary supplies
    needed for the user’s projects that relate to quilting. Giving widespread
    of options to choose from to get their ‘masterpiece’.
    Whether it be patterns, fabrics, or kits we have it.
    Making it easy to navigate and accessible to the user.
    The audience is intended for women with the age range of 25-75 years.
    One of the ways that the website accomplishes its purpose is the tabs
    across the top. This makes it easy to switch from one page to the other in
    a descriptive manner. The grouping is organized that’s understandable and
    easy to follow. We also make it easy to find deals so they can have a sale
    on their next purchase item.
