   <h2>Design Principles</h2>
   <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs three items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

   <h3>Repetition &mdash;

   <p>
     Repetition- In the mobile website for thriftbooks.com,
     the repetition is consistent throughout the website.
     The font color, size and type are consistent and repetitive which makes
     the user interface easy and understandable. Other elements such as like
     images, proximity and alignment of the text and images are all consistent
     and repetitive in all the pages. The vision and pattern in all of the
     web-pages gives a sense of familiarity and consistency.
   </p>

   <h3>Contrast &mdash;
    <!-- Replace this comment with the team member name responsible for contrast -->
   </h3>
   <img src="" alt="Screen shot illustrating contrast in use">
   <p>
     Contrast- The contrast is visually appealing in terms of the text color,
     background color, shape and size of the images and objects.
     The design principle of contrast which is used in this website makes
     the web-pages more clean and visually appealing.
