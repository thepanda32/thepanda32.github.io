   <h1>Design - Analysis Assessment</h1>
   <h2> Thriftbooks.com</h2>
   <h2>Design Principles</h2>
   <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs three items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

   <h3>Proximity &mdash;
     Britany Wiseman
   </h3>
   <img src="analysis_pictures\Proximity.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating proximity in use">
   <p>
     With Proximity, the website put the ‘Bestsellers’ categories of books
     next to each other that it could be easily found. </br>
     Thus, drawing the users attention to the items right next to it,
     assuming they were going to be similar. With this proximity it helps
     show that they relate in some shape or form.

   </p>

   <h3>Alignment &mdash;
     Britany Wiseman
   </h3>
   <img src="analysis_pictures\alignment.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating alignment in use">
   <p>
     An example alignment found on this website is found in the side tab
     bringing up more options. With the left side alignment,
     it shows the different tabs for more information. </br>
     When one of these selections was chosen, it added a slight alignment to
     the sub categories.
     Allowing the user to recognize the sub categories were separate.

   </p>

   <h3>Repetition &mdash;
     Serah Doraiswamy
   </h3>
   <img src="analysis_pictures\Repetative.png" alt="Screen shot illustrating repetition in use">
   <p>
     In the mobile website for thriftbooks.com,
     the repetition is consistent throughout the website.
     The font color, size and type are consistent and repetitive which makes
     the user interface easy and understandable. </br>Other elements such as like
     images, proximity and alignment of the text and images are all consistent
     and repetitive in all the pages. The vision and pattern in all of the
     web-pages gives a sense of familiarity and consistency.
   </p>

   <h3>Contrast &mdash;
     Serah Doraiswamy
   </h3>
   <img src="analysis_pictures\Contrast 1.png" alt="Screen shot illustrating contrast in use">
   <p>
     The contrast is visually appealing in terms of the text color,
     background color, shape and size of the images and objects. </br>
     The design principle of contrast which is used in this website makes
     the web-pages more clean and visually appealing.
   </p>

   <h3>Typography &mdash;
     Chase Bush
   </h3>
   <img src="analysis_pictures\typography1.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating typography in use">
   <p>
     The typography seems to follow a specific pattern on this website. The main
     font used is a sans-serif font with mostly black and green colored text
     thorughout the page. </br> They've used different colors as well as features like
     bolding text to emphasize important features such as links. </br>Overall the
     typography decisions come together to pull off a simple and modern look.

   <h2>Site Purpose Statement</h2>
   <p>

    of options to choose from to get their ‘masterpiece’.
    Whether it be patterns, fabrics, or kits we have it.

    The audience is intended for women with the age range of 25-75 years.
    One of the ways that the website accomplishes its purpose is the tabs
